#+TITLE: Overlays

All =*.nix= files are automatically imported if using this configuration, if they are staged to the git worktree.

However, one may not have this feature in their setup.

One may copy and use the contents of one of these files in this manner:

#+begin_src nix
# in configuration.nix / home.nix
nixpkgs.overlays = [
  (/* insert contents of file, important that it's enclosed in parentheses */)
];
#+end_src
