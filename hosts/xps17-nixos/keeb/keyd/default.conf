# Advanced use of capslock as a triple function key:
#
# - when 'capslock' is tapped (pressed + released), it behaves as ESC key
#
# - when 'capslock' is held, and used in combination with another key, it
#   behaves like a 'ctrl' key modifier (just like xcape)
#
# - when 'capslock' is held, and the 'space' key is tapped, we enter a 3rd
#   state for "VIM mode" where hjkl keys become arrow keys until capslock
#   is released.
